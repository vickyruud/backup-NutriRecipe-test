MAKE SAUCE
Heat the oil in a large pot over medium-high heat (we use a Dutch oven). Add the meat and cook until browned, about 8 minutes. As the meat cooks, use a wooden spoon to break it up into smaller crumbles.

Add the onions and cook, stirring every once and a while, until softened, about 5 minutes.

Stir in the garlic, tomato paste, oregano, and red pepper flakes and cook, stirring continuously for about 1 minute.

Pour in the water and use a wooden spoon to scrape up any bits of meat or onion stuck to the bottom of the pot. Stir in the tomatoes, 3/4 teaspoon of salt, and a generous pinch of black pepper. Bring the sauce to a low simmer. Cook, uncovered, at a low simmer for 25 minutes. As it cooks, stir and taste the sauce a few times so you can adjust the seasoning accordingly (see notes for suggestions).

COOK SPAGHETTI
About 15 minutes before the sauce finishes cooking, bring a large pot of salted water to the boil, and then cook pasta according to package directions, but check for doneness a minute or two before the suggested cooking time.

TO FINISH
Take the sauce off of the heat, and then stir in the basil. Toss in the cooked pasta, and then leave for a minute so that the pasta absorbs some of the sauce. Toss again, and then serve with parmesan sprinkled on top.",6,45,5,"https://res.cloudinary.com/de6puygvt/image/upload/w_1000,c_fill,ar_1:1,g_auto,r_max,bo_5px_solid_red,b_rgb:262c35/v1643926325/recipes/spaghetti/Spaghetti-with-Meat-Sauce-Recipe-3-1200_trhlns.jpg"

MAKE BATTER
Heat the oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit (176C). Line a 12-cup muffin pan with cupcake liners.

In a medium bowl, whisk the flour, cocoa powder, baking soda and salt until well blended. If your cocoa powder is lumpy, sift these ingredients instead.

In another medium bowl, whisk the sugars with the oil, vinegar and vanilla extract.

Switch to a large rubber spatula. Scrape the sides and bottom of the bowl then add the dry ingredients in two parts, gently stirring until they disappear. The batter will be very thick — that’s okay.

Pour in the hot coffee (or water) and stir until blended and the batter is mostly smooth.

BAKE CUPCAKES
Pour or spoon the batter into the liners, filling about 3/4 of the way to the top. Gently tap the pan on the work surface a few times to remove any large air bubbles from the batter, and then bake until the tops of the cupcakes are springy when touched and when a toothpick inserted into the center of the cake comes out clean, 20 to 25 minutes.

Cool cupcakes in the pan then frost or store, in an airtight container, at room temperature for 2 to 3 days, in the refrigerator 4 to 5 days or in the freezer up to two months.

MAKE BUTTERCREAM
This recipe makes enough frosting to generously frost the cupcakes. We typically have frosting leftover since we prefer our cupcakes with a bit less frosting on top. If you are swirling the frosting on using a piping tip, this recipe should be plenty.

Add butter (or vegan butter sticks) to a bowl and beat until light and fluffy using a handheld mixer (or use a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment).

If the powdered sugar is lumpy, sift it.

Add the vanilla, salt and sugar until well incorporated and the frosting is fluffy. If it seem too thick, thin it out with a splash of cream, milk or non-dairy milk. If it is too thin, add 1/4 to 1/2 cup more powdered sugar.

Store the frosting in an air-tight container for up to 5 days in the refrigerator or freeze up to two months.",16,30,0,https://res.cloudinary.com/de6puygvt/image/upload/v1643930810/recipes/Easy-Chocolate-Cupcakes-Recipe-2-1200_rphtkb.jpg
