8,3,Excellent recipe!!!
7,4,"This recipe is all you need to accomplish an amazing dinner!!! My family loved it! Even the little ones who typically don't love seafood. We ate it with ""arepas de coco"" (coconut fried bread). Delicious!!!"
6,5,This looks so delicious! I am putting this on my to-make list - I love any kind of seafood & tomato stew combo.
5,6,"I had this recipe saved for months before I finally decided to try it out. I've only recently gotten more comfortable in the kitchen. It turned out really great. It was a big hit with my 16 year old. I bought the can of pigeon peas with coconut milk. I thought that was an interesting addition. Otherwise, I followed the recipe to a tee. Just wanted to say thank you! for adding to this home chef-in-training's repertoire. We loved it!"
4,7,"It was so delicious! I always love reading Marta's recepies, easy to follow, entertaining and pure flavour. Soaking the rice really makes the trick, it's the first time I make this dish and I couldn't be happier. I didn't have shrimp (covid-19 limitations) but it still came out great! I also like that you get one full meal in just one pot! Works great as a meal prep. I just vary the sides."
3,8,"My kids loved this dish and kept picking out savory bits of ham, shrimp, and so forth. I was happy to have leftovers. The flavors are just great."
2,9,"Must be an acquired taste. It looked fantastic, but there was a flavor that overwhelmed everything else for me. Perhaps the Recaito or Sazon."
1,10,"Recaito is mostly cilantro and onions, both common ingredient in Western cooking. If you managed to get authentic recaito, it may taste different. Saizon is mostly salt and garlic, so that's not likely to be off-putting. The capers and olives can be quite strong, if you happen to get a mouth full of them. And of course, it's possible that you're allergic to cilantro or coriander."
